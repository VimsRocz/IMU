# Plot Summary

This document provides a short description of the output figures generated by `GNSS_IMU_Fusion.py`.

- **positions.pdf** - Estimated ECEF position from the Kalman filter. The North, East and Down components are plotted over time.
- **residuals.pdf** - Residuals between the filter predictions and the GNSS measurements. Solid lines show position residuals, dashed lines show velocity residuals.
- **attitude.pdf** - Estimated attitude angles (roll, pitch, yaw) over time. In this simplified example only the yaw angle derived from the GNSS velocity is varying.
