"""Locate or copy a data file to the project root.

This stub mirrors the MATLAB ``ensure_input_file`` utility.  The Python
implementation is pending.  When implemented it should search common
locations for a given file and copy it to the project root so subsequent
runs operate on a stable set of inputs.

Usage
-----
    ensure_input_file('IMU', 'IMU_X002.dat', paths)

    Parameters
    ----------
    kind : str
        Label for diagnostic messages (e.g. "IMU" or "GNSS").
    fname : str
        Name of the file to locate.
    paths : dict

    Returns
    -------
    Path
        Absolute path to the resolved file.

    Notes
    -----
    Placeholder implementation; real logic will mirror the MATLAB version.
