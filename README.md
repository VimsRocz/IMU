# IMU-
IMU data processing and initialization tools (Python)

## Installation

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Notes

`GNSS_IMU_Fusion.py` now detects a low-motion interval in the IMU data to
estimate the initial accelerometer and gyroscope biases. The magnitude of the
static accelerometer vector is used to compute a simple scale factor so that the
measured gravity is close to 9.81 m/s². This improves the attitude
initialisation when the first samples are not perfectly static or the sensor
scale is slightly off.
