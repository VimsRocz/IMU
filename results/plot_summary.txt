velocity_profile.pdf - Shows GNSS and filter predicted velocity over time.
Key Point: Indicates filter convergence quality.

attitude_angles_over_time.pdf - Filter-derived roll, pitch and yaw for the entire dataset.
Key Point: Helps visualise orientation drift.

position_residuals_vs_time.pdf - Difference between filter and GNSS positions for N/E/D.
Key Point: Residual spikes highlight GNSS dropouts or filter misalignment.

velocity_residuals_vs_time.pdf - Velocity residuals (filter minus GNSS) in N/E/D.
Key Point: Validates velocity update performance.
