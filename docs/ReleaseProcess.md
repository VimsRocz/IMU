# Release Process

Follow these steps when preparing a new release:

1. Update the project version in `pyproject.toml`.
2. Update the `version:` field in `CITATION.cff` to match.
3. Commit the changes and tag the release as usual.

Keeping these files in sync ensures that package metadata and citations reflect the same version.
