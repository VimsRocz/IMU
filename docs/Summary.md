## Filter Results Summary

This appendix provides a high‑level overview of the figures generated by the
processing scripts.  Each run populates `PYTHON/results/` with PDF files named
`<dataset>_<method>_<description>.pdf`.  The sections below describe the most
common outputs and how to interpret them.

### Residuals
`residuals_<tag>.pdf` plots the difference between the fused INS estimate and
the GNSS updates for the North/East/Down components.  Healthy filters produce
curves that remain centred around zero with a small variance.

### Attitude Angles
`attitude_angles_<tag>.pdf` shows roll, pitch, and yaw derived from the stored
quaternions.  A stable solution settles to smooth curves after the initial
transient period.

### Truth vs Fused Difference
If a reference trajectory is available, `diff_truth_fused_over_time_<frame>.pdf`
visualises the component‑wise error between the truth data and the estimator
output.  Separate files are produced for the NED, ECEF, and body frames.

## Example – X001 / Davenport

*Figure 1.* **Residuals** – Difference between the fused INS estimate and the
GNSS updates for the North/East/Down components. These traces verify the
filter's consistency over time.

*Figure 2.* **Attitude angles** – Roll, pitch, and yaw derived from the stored
quaternions. A stable attitude solution is visible after the first few seconds.
