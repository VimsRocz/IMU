% MATLAB Pipeline Synchronization Summary
% =====================================
%
% This file documents the changes made to synchronize the MATLAB pipeline 
% with the Python reference implementation for IMU-GNSS fusion.
%
% ISSUES RESOLVED:
% ================
%
% 1. MISSING VARIABLES IN TASK 5
%    Problem: Task 5 was failing because it expected variables with specific 
%             names that weren't being saved by previous tasks
%    Solution: Updated Task 1 and Task 4 to save variables with the correct names:
%             - Task 1: Added gravity_ned, lat0_rad, lon0_rad
%             - Task 4: Added pos_ned, vel_ned, acc_ned
%
% 2. OCTAVE COMPATIBILITY
%    Problem: MATLAB code used functions not available in Octave
%    Solution: Created compatibility functions:
%             - read_csv_table.m (replaces readtable)
%             - read_matrix.m (replaces readmatrix)
%             - Fixed sgtitle, exportgraphics, height, width functions
%
% 3. CONSISTENT VARIABLE NAMING
%    Problem: Inconsistent variable names between tasks
%    Solution: Ensured all tasks use consistent naming:
%             - gravity_ned (not g_NED)
%             - lat0_rad, lon0_rad (not lat, lon)
%             - pos_ned, vel_ned, acc_ned (not pos_est_ned, etc.)
%
% 4. FILE STRUCTURE SYNCHRONIZATION
%    Problem: Tasks saved different variable sets
%    Solution: Updated save/load logic to include all variables needed
%             by downstream tasks
%
% VERIFICATION:
% =============
% Run verify_pipeline.m to confirm all variables are present and accessible.
% The complete pipeline (Tasks 1-5) now runs without errors and produces
% consistent results with the Python implementation.
%
% TESTING:
% ========
% Test the pipeline with: run_triad_only
% Expected output: Successful completion of all tasks with proper variable flow
